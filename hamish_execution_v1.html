    <h1>Execution Mode: v1.0</h1>
    <h2>🧭 North: <em>Who am I being this week?</em></h2>
    <p>You’re the kind of person who builds. Not theorises, not dreams—<strong>executes</strong>.
    You’re stepping into the version of you that <em>finishes shit</em>, makes it visible, and owns it.
    You’re <strong>in the arena</strong>, not watching from the stands.</p>
    <blockquote>You're here to prove—not to others, but to yourself—that you can bridge the gap between ambition and output.</blockquote>

    <h2>🌍 Why does it matter?</h2>
    <p>Not because it “actually” matters in the cosmic sense. You already know it doesn’t.
    But because <strong>you’ve chosen</strong> to treat it as meaningful.
    You’re staging your own myth.
    The myth is: <em>You’re going to make things so good they can't ignore you.</em>
    And it starts here, in this dull, absurd, tiny week—<strong>not</strong> someday.</p>

    <h2>🧠 What does motivation look like in execution mode?</h2>
    <p>Motivation isn't a feeling. It’s a <strong>reframing mechanism</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>"I don’t feel like it"</code> → <code>"That’s irrelevant, this is the week I execute."</code></li>
        <li><code>"It might not work"</code> → <code>"So what? I still build it."</code></li>
        <li><code>"This doesn’t matter"</code> → <code>"Nothing does. That’s why it’s my job to choose what does."</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧱 Anchors for this week (your <em>structure</em>, not your tasks)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Singular priority</strong>: Output for Will’s gig is the <em>arena</em>. This is the thing you <strong>ship</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum viable uni</strong>: You’re not ignoring it, but you're not performing for it either. You’re getting it done, quietly.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection is paused</strong>: You’ve done your thinking. This week is for <strong>moving</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧤 Execution Mode Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No mid-week planning.</strong> That’s a trick. Planning is Monday’s job. You’re here to run the program you already wrote.</li>
        <li><strong>You are the agent, not the audience.</strong> If you’re spectating yourself, you’ve lost the thread.</li>
        <li><strong>Done is the metric.</strong> Not clever, not ideal, not optimised—just <strong>done</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
